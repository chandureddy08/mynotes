									SQL Commands:
									-------------
1. Data Retrieval – Think "SELECT"
SELECT: This is like asking the database for data.
“SELECT” tells the database what data you want.
Example:


SELECT * FROM Employees;
SELECT retrieves data (from one or more tables) based on your query. The asterisk * means "all columns."

2. Data Insertion – Think "INSERT INTO"
INSERT INTO: This is like adding new data to the table.
“INSERT INTO” tells the database where and what new data to add.
Example:

INSERT INTO Employees (EmployeeID, FirstName, LastName) 
VALUES (1, 'John', 'Doe');
INSERT INTO adds new records to a table.

3. Data Update – Think "UPDATE" (change data)
UPDATE: This is like editing data that's already in the table.
“UPDATE” tells the database what to change and where to make the changes.
Example:

UPDATE Employees 
SET Position = 'Manager' 
WHERE EmployeeID = 1;
UPDATE changes existing records in the table based on a condition.

4. Data Deletion – Think "DELETE FROM"
DELETE FROM: This is like removing data from the table.
“DELETE FROM” tells the database where to remove data.
Example:

DELETE FROM Employees WHERE EmployeeID = 1;
DELETE FROM removes rows from a table, based on a condition (or deletes all rows if no condition is provided).

5. Table Creation – Think "CREATE TABLE"
CREATE TABLE: This is like building a new table in the database.
“CREATE TABLE” tells the database what structure to create.
Example:

CREATE TABLE Employees (
    EmployeeID INT PRIMARY KEY,
    FirstName VARCHAR(50),
    LastName VARCHAR(50)
);
CREATE TABLE defines a new table and its columns.

6. Table Modification – Think "ALTER TABLE"
ALTER TABLE: This is like changing the structure of an existing table (e.g., adding/removing columns).
“ALTER TABLE” tells the database what changes to make to the table structure.
Example:

ALTER TABLE Employees ADD Email VARCHAR(100);
ALTER TABLE modifies an existing table by adding, deleting, or changing columns.

7. Table Deletion – Think "DROP TABLE"
DROP TABLE: This is like destroying the table completely.
“DROP TABLE” tells the database to remove the entire table.
Example:

DROP TABLE Employees;
DROP TABLE permanently removes a table and all of its data.

8. Filtering Results – Think "WHERE"
WHERE: This is like asking the database for data that meets a condition.
“WHERE” tells the database what conditions the data must meet.
Example:

SELECT * FROM Employees WHERE Position = 'Manager';
WHERE filters records based on a condition, like finding specific rows.

9. Sorting Results – Think "ORDER BY"
ORDER BY: This is like arranging the data in a particular order.
“ORDER BY” tells the database how to sort the results (ascending or descending).
Example:

SELECT * FROM Employees ORDER BY LastName ASC;
ORDER BY sorts the result set by one or more columns.

10. Grouping Data – Think "GROUP BY"
GROUP BY: This is like grouping similar data together to summarize it.
“GROUP BY” tells the database how to organize the data into groups.
Example:

SELECT Position, COUNT(*) FROM Employees GROUP BY Position;
GROUP BY groups records based on one or more columns, often used with aggregate functions like COUNT, SUM, AVG.

A Simple Mnemonic to Remember:
Selected Data – SELECT
Insert Data – INSERT INTO
Update Data – UPDATE
Delete Data – DELETE FROM
Create Table – CREATE TABLE
Alter Table – ALTER TABLE
Drop Table – DROP TABLE
Where Condition – WHERE
Order Results – ORDER BY
Group Data – GROUP BY
