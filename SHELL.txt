SHELL SCRIPT:
-------------

1) start with #!/bin/bash and use ###to give metadata like info about script and author.

2) varibles: to reduce the repitition and avoid to touch the main script. eg: PERSON1=chandu

3) arguments/parameters: use PERSON1=$1 to enter the parameters manually. eg: sh varibles.sh chandu john till nth varible(enter values while executing the script)

4) Invisible user name and passwod
echo "Please enter your username::"

read -s USERNAME   #user name is variable

echo "Please enter your Password::"

read -s PASSWORD

echo "Username is: $USERNAME, Password is $PASSWORD"
* without -s credentials are visible and with -s credentials are not visible.

5) Array: 
THINGS=("ant" "bat" "cat")
# size of array is 3
# list always starts with 0
# index are 0,1 and 2

echo "First movie is: ${THINGS[0]}"
echo "all the things are: ${THINGS[@]}

* array --> list of values like THINGS. To print a particular num of array we can do that by using array.
* use ${THINGS[@]} to print all the list of array.

6) sum operation
NO1=$1
NO2=$2

SUM=$(($NO1+$NO2))
echo "Total of $NO1 and $NO2 is: $SUM"

* Enter values while executing sh sum.sh 100 200

7) Special varibles

echo "All variables: $@"
echo "Number of variables passed: $#"
echo "Script name: $0"
echo "Current working directory: $PWD"
echo "Home directory of current user: $HOME"
echo "Which user is running this script: $USER"
echo "Host name: $HOSTNAME"
echo "Process id of the current shell script: $$"
sleep 65
echo "Process ID of last background command: $!"
echo "exit status of the last command executed: $?"
